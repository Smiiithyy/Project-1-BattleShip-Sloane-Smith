# Project-1-Battleship

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

The Approach Taken: I started out with creating psuedo code and planning out how I wanted the game to work. From there, I created the program in javascript and was able to play a version with the computer in the console. However, this is not translate when using DOM to change the text/visuals on the screen. I then changed my method to creating a visual shell in HTML and building the game boards in Javascript so they were dynamic depending on the preference of the player. After that, I manipulated the CSS.

Unsolved Problems: I need to put a loop on the amount of ships the player can actually place on the board. Additionally, when attacking, the player can technically click on the same square twice which would trigger the enemy to attak. Other items, that are not necessarily unsolved, are developing the game to make the ships varying lengths. I would also like to have a homepage where the player clicks into the game instead of going right to the gameboard. The images and overall graphics need improvement.
